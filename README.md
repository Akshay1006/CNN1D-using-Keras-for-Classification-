# DNN and CNN 1D for Classification Using Keras

This Repository will utilize Multi Layer Neural Network and convolutional Neural Networks in 1 Dimension for a classification task using Keras and tensforflow as backend

Major Steps are:

1) Data Preparation - These are standard steps in any process before sending the data for Training
2) Training - Multi Layer Neural Network - Using the Independent features as Nodes for Classification
3) Training CNN1D - Convolving across Rows - Capture the spatial relationship across all the independent features in one go
4) Training CNN1D- Convolving across Columns - Capture the spatial relationship between set of features and then concatenating the most informative feature in the subsequent layers
