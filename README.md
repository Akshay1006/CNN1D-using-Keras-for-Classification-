#CNN1D on a single time window for classification tasks

This Repository will utilize convolutional Neural Networks in 1 Dimension for a classification task using Keras and tensforflow as backend

Major Steps are:

1) Data Preparation - These are standard steps in any process before sending the data for Training
2) Training - Convolving across Rows - Capture the spatial relationship across all the independent features in one go
3) Training - Convolving across Columns - Capture the spatial relationship between set of features and then concatenating the most informative feature in the subsequent layers
